# Add a declarative step here for populating the DB with movies.

Given /the following movies exist/ do |movies_table|
  movies_table.hashes.each do |movie|
    Movie.create!(movie)
  end
end

Then /^the director of "([^"]*)" should be "([^"]*)"$/ do |movieTitle, director|
  movieTitle.in?(Movie.where(:director => director).select(:title))
end
